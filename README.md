# Mars Webscraping
Module 11 Challenge

This project contained two parts. The first ask was to scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. The second ask was to scrape and analyze Mars weather data. The analysis for both parts is included below.

## Part 1: Mars News
I was asked to scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. Using the site <a href> https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html </a> I pulled a list of 15 titles and previews and compiled them in a json file. The first five titles and previews have been listed here.
